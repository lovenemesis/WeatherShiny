# WeatherShiny
A Shiny App for Developing Data Product of Data Science Specilization on Coursera

The target user group is the potential visitors to Xi'an, my home town.
Winter is a time that has lots of tradtional Chinese festivial, including the most important Sprint Festival(sounds odd but true).
Thus it's a ideal time to visit the ancient Xi'an, which have many seasonal delicacies and ceremonies. 

However, the weather in winter is a bit unpredictable. Thus it would be wise to look up the weather before the visit. That's where this App can help.

It pulls the various weather data about past days in winter, 2015. In a way that it can be a reference guide during planning. 

Also it contains several links pointing to trustful tourist information.
